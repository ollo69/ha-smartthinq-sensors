"""Global fixtures for integration_blueprint integration."""

# Fixtures allow you to replace functions with a Mock object. You can perform
# many options via the Mock to reflect a particular behavior from the original
# function that you want to see without going through the function's actual logic.
# Fixtures can either be passed into tests as parameters, or if autouse=True, they
# will automatically be used across all tests.
#
# Fixtures that are defined in conftest.py are available across all tests. You can also
# define fixtures within a particular test file to scope them locally.
#
# pytest_homeassistant_custom_component provides some fixtures that are provided by
# Home Assistant core. You can find those fixture definitions here:
# https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component/blob/master/pytest_homeassistant_custom_component/common.py
#
# See here for more info: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html (note that
# pytest includes fixtures OOB which you can use as defined on this page)
