# LG ThinQ Devices integration for HomeAssistant

A HomeAssistant custom integration to monitor and control LG devices using ThinQ API based on [WideQ project][wideq].

Supported devices are:

- Air Conditioner
- Air Purifier
- Dehumidifier
- Dishwasher
- Dryer
- Fan
- Microwave
- Range
- Refrigerator
- Styler
- Washer
- Water Heater

**Important**: The component will **not work if you have logged into the ThinQ application and registered your devices using a social network account** (Google, Facebook or Amazon). In order to use the component you need to create a new independent LG account and make sure you log into the ThinQ app and associate your devices with it.
If during configuration you receive the message "No SmartThinQ devices found", probably your devices are still associated with the social network account. To solve the problem perform the following step:

- remove your devices from the ThinQ app
- logout from the app and login again with the independent LG account
- reconnect the devices in the app

**Important 2**: If you receive an "Invalid Credential" error during component configuration/startup, check in the LG mobile app if is requested to accept new Term Of Service.

**Note**: some device status may not be correctly detected, this depends on the model. I'm working to map all possible status developing the component in a way to allow to configure model option in the simplest possible way and provide update using Pull Requests. I will provide a guide on how update this information.

## Component configuration

Once the component has been installed, you need to configure it using the web interface in order to make it work.

1. Go to "Settings->Devices & Services".
2. Hit shift-reload in your browser (this is important!).
3. Click "+ Add Integration".
4. Search for "SmartThinQ LGE Sensors"
5. Select the integration and **Follow setup workflow**

**Important**: use your country and language code: SmartThinQ accounts are associated with a specific locale,
so be sure to use the country and language you originally created your account with.
Reference for valid code:

- Country code: [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code][ISO-3166-1-alpha-2]
- Language code: [ISO 639-1 code][ISO-639-1]

## Be kind

If you like the component, why don't you support me by buying me a coffee?
It would certainly motivate me to further improve this work.
