A HomeAssistant custom integration to monitor and control LG devices using ThinQ API based on [WideQ project][wideq].

Supported devices are:

- Air Conditioner
- Air Purifier
- Dehumidifier
- Dishwasher
- Dryer
- Fan
- Range
- Refrigerator
- Styler
- Washer

**Important**: The component will **not work if you have logged into the ThinQ application and registered your devices using a social network account** (Google, Facebook or Amazon). In order to use the component you need to create a new independent LG account and make sure you log into the ThinQ app and associate your devices with it.
If during configuration you receive the message "No SmartThinQ devices found", probably your devices are still associated with the social network account. To solve the problem perform the following step:

- remove your devices from the ThinQ app
- logout from the app and login again with the independent LG account
- reconnect the devices in the app

**Important 2**: If you receive an "Invalid Credential" error during component configuration/startup, check in the LG mobile app if is requested to accept new Term Of Service.

**Note**: some device status may not be correctly detected, this depends on the model. I'm working to map all possible status developing the component in a way to allow to configure model option in the simplest possible way and provide update using Pull Requests. I will provide a guide on how update this information.

## Installation

You can install this component in two ways: via [HACS](https://github.com/hacs/integration) or manually.

### Option A: Installing via HACS

If you have HACS, just go in the Integration Tab and search the "SmartThinQ LGE Sensors" component and install it.

### Option B: Manual installation (custom_component)

Prerequisite: SSH into your server.
[Home Assistant Add-on: SSH server](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/tree/master/ssh)

1. Clone the git master branch.
`git clone https://github.com/ollo69/ha-smartthinq-sensors.git`
2. If missing, create a `custom_components` directory where your configuration.yaml file resides. This is usually in the config directory of homeassistant.
`mkdir ~/.homeassistant/custom_components`
3. Copy the smartthinq_sensors directory within the `custom_components` directory of your homeassistant installation from step 2.
`cp -R ha-smartthinq-sensors/custom_components/smartthinq_sensors/ ~/.homeassistant/custom_components`
4. (Optional) Delete the git repo.
`rm -R ha-smartthinq-sensors/`

    After a correct installation, your configuration directory should look like the following.

    ```shell
        └── ...
        └── configuration.yaml
        └── secrects.yaml
        └── custom_components
            └── smartthinq_sensors
                └── __init__.py
                └── config_flow.py
                └── const.py
                └── ...
    ```

5. Reboot HomeAssistant

## Component configuration

Once the component has been installed, you need to configure it using the web interface in order to make it work.

1. Go to "Settings->Devices & Services".
2. Hit shift-reload in your browser (this is important!).
3. Click "+ Add Integration".
4. Search for "SmartThinQ LGE Sensors"
5. Select the integration and **Follow setup workflow**

**Important**: use your country and language code: SmartThinQ accounts are associated with a specific locale,
so be sure to use the country and language you originally created your account with.
Reference for valid code:

- Country code: [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code][ISO-3166-1-alpha-2]
- Language code: [ISO 639-1 code][ISO-639-1]

### Entities

| Entity ID | Entity Name | Description |
| :-- | :-: | :-- |
| sensor.my_washer | My Washer | Washer, turns On when on, turns Off when off |
| binary_sensor.my_washer_wash_completed | My Washer Wash Completed | Turns On when washer completed wash. You can use it in automations by triggering them when it goes from Off to On. |
| binary_sensor.my_washer_error_state | My Washer Error State | Off/OK means that it's fine. On/Error means there's an error. |
| sensor.my_dryer | My Dryer | Dryer, turns On when on, turns Off when off |

| binary_sensor.my_dryer_error_state | My Dryer Error State | Off/OK means that it's fine. On/Error means there's an error. |

#### Attributes `sensor.my_washer`

Note: When something doesn't apply and/or is off, it may have a `-` as its value. Also, these are for @KTibow's washer, values may differ for yours. Feel free to open an issue/PR.

#### Examples (washer/dryer)

- Get a notification when the clothes are done drying (or when the clothes are done washing, automation)

```yaml
- id: 'dry_clothes_notification'
  alias: "Dry clothes notification"
  description: "Alert when dryer finishes"
  trigger:
  - entity_id: binary_sensor.my_dryer_dry_completed
    platform: state
    to: 'on'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      title: "The clothes are dry!"
      message: "Get them while they're hot!"
    service: notify.notify
```

You can substitute "dry" and "dryer" for "wet" and "washer" if you want to use with a washer, for example.

## Be kind

If you like the component, why don't you support me by buying me a coffee?
It would certainly motivate me to further improve this work.
